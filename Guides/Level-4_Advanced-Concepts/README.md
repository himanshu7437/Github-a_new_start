## **1. Git Rebase and Squash**

**Git Rebase** and **Git Squash** are advanced techniques used to modify commit history in Git. These tools are useful for cleaning up commit history before merging branches and keeping your Git history linear and readable.

### **Git Rebase:**

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Instead of merging, rebase re-applies changes from one branch onto another branch.

1. To rebase your current branch onto the latest commit from another branch (e.g., main):

    ```bash
    git checkout <your-branch>
    git rebase main
    ```

2. If conflicts occur, resolve them manually, then use:

    ```bash
    git rebase --continue
    ```

### **Git Squash:**

Squashing combines multiple commits into one, making the commit history more concise. This is typically used for cleaning up commits before merging a feature branch.

1. Start an interactive rebase:

    ```bash
    git rebase -i <commit-id>
    ```

2. Mark the commits you want to squash with `s` (for squash) or `f` (for fixup).
3. After squashing, push the changes:

    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch> --force
    ```

## **2. GitHub Actions for Automation**

**GitHub Actions** is a feature that allows you to automate workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying code directly from your GitHub repository. Itâ€™s based on YAML configuration files that define your workflows.

### **Setting Up a Basic GitHub Action:**

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
2. Click **New Workflow** and choose a template or create a custom YAML file.
3. Define the steps, such as running tests, deploying code, or building your project. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple workflow for running tests:

    ```yaml
    name: Run Tests

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '14'
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
          - name: Run tests
            run: npm test
    ```

This YAML configuration runs tests every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## **3. Hosting with GitHub Pages**

**GitHub Pages** allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Itâ€™s an easy way to showcase projects, portfolios, or documentation.

### **Steps to Host a Website:**

1. Create a new branch named `gh-pages` (or use the `main` branch).
2. Add your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS) to the repository.
3. Go to your repository settings.
4. Under the **GitHub Pages** section, select the branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`) to deploy from.
5. Your website will be live at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`.

## **4. Using .gitignore and Git LFS**

### **.gitignore:**

A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing changes. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build files, and sensitive data.

1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository.
2. Add the patterns for the files you want to exclude. For example:

    ```
    # Ignore Node.js dependencies
    node_modules/

    # Ignore log files
    *.log
    ```

3. Save the `.gitignore` file and commit it to your repository. Git will ignore the files specified in this file.

### **Git LFS (Large File Storage):**

Git LFS is an extension for Git to manage large files, such as videos, images, or datasets, that would otherwise slow down the repository.

1. Install Git LFS:

    ```bash
    git lfs install
    ```

2. Track a specific file type with LFS (e.g., images):

    ```bash
    git lfs track "*.png"
    ```

3. Commit the `.gitattributes` file that Git LFS creates to your repository.
4. Git LFS will automatically handle large files for you.
