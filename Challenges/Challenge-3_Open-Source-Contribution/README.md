# **Challenge 3: Open Source Contribution**

In this challenge, you will make your first contribution to an **Open-Source Project** on GitHub. Open-source contributions help you engage with the community, improve your skills, and collaborate with other developers.

### **Challenge Steps**

1. **Find an Open-Source Project**
   - Explore popular open-source repositories on GitHub.
   - Look for projects that interest you or match your skills.
   - Focus on repositories with clear contribution guidelines and active maintainers.

2. **Fork the Repository**
   - Fork the project repository to your own GitHub account to create your copy.
   - Make sure to read the **Contributing Guidelines** (usually in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file).

3. **Clone the Repository Locally**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
     ```

4. **Make Your Changes**
   - Create a new branch for the changes you want to make:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```
   - Make the necessary changes or additions to the codebase.

5. **Commit and Push**
   - Once your changes are complete, commit them to your branch with a clear commit message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes"
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - After pushing your changes to your forked repository, create a **pull request** to the original repository.
   - Follow the project's instructions for submitting a pull request.

7. **Wait for Review and Feedback**
   - Maintain communication with the project maintainers.
   - If required, make adjustments to your code based on feedback.
