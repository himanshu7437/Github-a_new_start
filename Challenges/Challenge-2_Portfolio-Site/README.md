# **Challenge 2: Create a Portfolio Website**

In this challenge, you will create a personal **Portfolio Website** to showcase your skills, projects, and achievements. You will host the website on **GitHub Pages** and apply your GitHub knowledge, such as version control, creating branches, and collaboration.

### **Challenge Steps**

1. **Set up a repository on GitHub**
   - Create a new repository named `portfolio-site`.
   - Initialize it with a `README.md` file and a `.gitignore` file (for HTML/CSS/JavaScript setups).
   
2. **Build your Portfolio Website**
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple, yet visually appealing, portfolio.
   - Sections to include:
     - **About Me**: Brief introduction and your professional background.
     - **Projects**: Showcase your best projects (GitHub repositories, apps, etc.).
     - **Contact**: How people can get in touch with you (email, LinkedIn, etc.).
     - **Skills**: List your key technical skills and technologies you're familiar with.

3. **Version Control**
   - **Commit frequently**: Make sure to commit changes as you complete sections of your website.
   - **Use branches**: Create separate branches for sections like `about-me`, `projects`, and `contact`.
   - **Pull requests**: Once a section is complete, create a pull request to merge it into the main branch.

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Use **GitHub Pages** to host your website. You can enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.
   - [Learn more about GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

5. **Collaborate (Optional)**
   - If you're working with others or want feedback, collaborate using **issues**, **pull requests**, and **code reviews**.
