# **Challenge 1: Build a To-Do App** 📝

Welcome to the first challenge! In this challenge, you'll be building a simple **To-Do List** application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge will help you apply GitHub's basic features such as commits, branches, pull requests, and collaboration.

### **Challenge Steps** 🚀

1. **Set up a repository on GitHub** 🌍
   - Create a new repository named `todo-app`.
   - Initialize it with a `README.md` file and a `.gitignore` file (for Node.js or other relevant setups).

2. **Design your To-Do App** 🎨
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a functional To-Do List.  
   - Features to implement:
     - Add tasks to the list ➕.
     - Mark tasks as completed ✅.
     - Delete tasks ❌.
     - Store tasks in local storage so that they persist after the page is refreshed 🔒.

3. **Version Control** 🧑‍💻
   - **Commit frequently**: Make sure to commit your changes regularly with meaningful commit messages ✍️.
   - **Use branches**: Create different branches for each feature, like adding a task, marking tasks complete, and deleting tasks 🌱.
   - **Merge branches**: Once you finish a feature, create a pull request and merge it into the main branch 🔄.

4. **Collaborate (Optional)** 🤝
   - If you're working with others, collaborate using **issues**, **pull requests**, and **code reviews**.

5. **GitHub Pages (Optional)** 🌐
   - Host your To-Do app on **GitHub Pages** for free. [Learn more](https://pages.github.com/).

- GitHub repository creation and setup.
- Git basics: commits, branches, and pull requests.
- How to work with others in a team (if collaborating).
- Deploying a project using GitHub Pages.
