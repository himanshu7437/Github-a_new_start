# **Challenge 1: Build a To-Do App**

Welcome to the first challenge! In this challenge, you'll be building a simple **To-Do List** application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This challenge will help you apply GitHub's basic features such as commits, branches, pull requests, and collaboration.

### **Challenge Steps**

1. **Set up a repository on GitHub**
   - Create a new repository named `todo-app`.
   - Initialize it with a `README.md` file and a `.gitignore` file (for Node.js or other relevant setups).

2. **Design your To-Do App**
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a functional To-Do List.  
   - Features to implement:
     - Add tasks to the list.
     - Mark tasks as completed.
     - Delete tasks.
     - Store tasks in local storage so that they persist after the page is refreshed.

3. **Version Control**
   - **Commit frequently**: Make sure to commit your changes regularly with meaningful commit messages.
   - **Use branches**: Create different branches for each feature, like adding a task, marking tasks complete, and deleting tasks.
   - **Merge branches**: Once you finish a feature, create a pull request and merge it into the main branch.

4. **Collaborate (Optional)**
   - If you're working with others, collaborate using **issues**, **pull requests**, and **code reviews**.

5. **GitHub Pages (Optional)**
   - Host your To-Do app on **GitHub Pages** for free. [Learn more](https://pages.github.com/).

### **What Youâ€™ll Learn**
- GitHub repository creation and setup.
- Git basics: commits, branches, and pull requests.
- How to work with others in a team (if collaborating).
- Deploying a project using GitHub Pages.
